##Planned Enhancements
The following enhancements are targeted to be delivered in mid-2016.  Placeholders for some of these new features are already built into the application.

* The ability to submit a daily pool visitation form or checklist for your assigned pool.

* An employee phone book with the ability to search by name or pool location..

* The ability to view messages posted on the employee message board.  Currently these messages are only accessible via the SwimMetro Management website at [www.swimmetro.com](http://www.swimmetro.com).

* The addition of a settings page that will allow the user to set their default pool.  THis default will then be used to pre-select items in the various request forms.  It will also be used to annotate the user's preferred pool in the Customer Locations feature.
